### Power Budget ###
------
The power requried to run major components for the stepper driver and motor. The power budget focused on both the supply voltage range and the maximum amont of current each component would take. This with then given a 25% safety margin to give a little more room to determine the most amount of amperage being drawn by the device. From this, I can determine how much I need and how much I can send to others through the connectoin.
